# Face Recognition Based Attendance System
Daily attendance marking is a common and important activity in schools and colleges for checking the regularity and sincerity of students.
Manual Attendance maintenance is a difficult process, especially for a large group of students. To overcome this problem, we have developed a GUI application system that takes attendance of students by recognizing their faces and saves data 
in a separate excel file.

## Implementation
This is our main page. Students have to fill their details with image samples in the Student section. Once details are filled in, the captured images have to train with their IDs.

Once images are trained, the student can detect their faces and their attendance will be automatically recorded in an excel file.
